  <!-- Explanation of logic: EOD vs early close -->
  <section class="panel">
    <h2 class="section-title">How this scan works</h2>
    <p class="section-subtitle">
      The core Gann logic always runs on the <strong>full daily bar</strong> (H, L, O, C)
      of the last completed session. That is how swings and squares are detected and
      how the backtest is generated.
    </p>
    <p class="section-subtitle">
      In addition, you are now collecting an <strong>early close</strong> for every
      stock – approximately 10 minutes before the market close. If the early close
      is still within a safe margin from the square levels, then you can
      <strong>pre-enter</strong> the trade on the <strong>signal date itself</strong>,
      instead of waiting for next-day confirmation.
    </p>
    <p class="section-subtitle">
      This page is designed exactly for that:
      it shows which stocks generated signals, and whether the early-close price
      keeps the signal safe or already too close to the “flip” point.
    </p>

      <strong>most recent trading day</strong>. This is the list you watch
      during the last 10–15 minutes of the session using early-close prices.

      Interpretation:
      <br>
      – <strong>Neutral Margin</strong> ≈ how many points the price can still move
      before the signal becomes unsafe but not opposite.<br>
      – <strong>Flip Margin</strong> ≈ how many points remain before the square level
      is broken in the opposite direction and the setup flips (buy → sell or sell → buy).
